# Implementing an internal DSL: regular expressions

## Overview

In this assignment, you'll use the techniques we've learned in class to
implement an internal DSL. This internal DSL allows users to easily check
whether a given string matches a pattern. For example, imagine a user wants to
check whether a string `s` takes the form of a letter, followed by a number
(e.g., `c3`). In your DSL, the user might write:

```
val pattern = letter ~ number
pattern matches s
```

Patterns like this are called _regular expressions_. Before you start
implementing a DSL for the domain of regular expressions, you should first read
the next section, which describes everything you'll need to know about this
domain.

## Background: regular expressions

A regular expression is a shorthand notation for describing a collection of 
strings, all of which match a pattern. As an informal example, the pattern `watch(es)`
describes a set of two strings: `{watch, watches}`. Similarly, the pattern
`colo(u)r` also contains two strings: `{color, colour}`. Neither of these
informal patterns is a regular expression in the formal sense, but they give a
sense of how a pattern can stand in for a set of strings.

The most precise definition of regular expressions is a formal one, i.e., one
that's based on math. That's the definition we're most interested in because
it's easy to translate it into code. Let's look at the formal definition of
regular expressions...

We start with an **alphabet**, which is a set of characters. For this
assignment, our alphabet will be any character that can appear in a
Scala string, i.e., anything that the Scala compiler will let us put between two
quotes like so: `'a'`.

A **string** _s_ is a sequence of characters `c1⋅⋅⋅cn`; this string has length
n. There is a special string called the **null** string, spelled ε; this string
has length 0. 

A **language** _L_ is a set of strings. We think of this set as all the strings
that match a particular pattern. 

Given an alphabet, the **regular languages** “over that alphabet” can be 
defined as follows:

   + The empty language ∅ is regular. This language contains 0 strings.
   + The language {ε} that contains one string—the null string—is regular.
   + If c is a character from the alphabet, then the language {c} that contains 
   one string is regular.
   + If L1 and L2 are regular languages (i.e., they're each sets of strings),
   then the language L1 ∪ L2 (i.e., the union of the two languages) is regular.
   + If L1 and L2 are regular, then the language L1 ⋅ L2  = {s1 ⋅ s2 | s1 ∈ L1 ∧
   s2 ∈ L2} is regular. Here, the symbol ⋅ means "concatenation". So s1 ⋅ s2 is
   all the characters in s1, followed by all the characters in s2.
   + If L is regular, then L* is regular. Here, the symbol * means "0 or more
   repetitions of any string in L". So, if L is the language that contains the
   single string `ab`, then L* is {ε, ab, abab, ababab, …}.

A **regular expression** is a short-hand description for a regular language. For
example, the regular expression `42` describes the language `{42}`,
which contains a single string. The regular expression `4 || 2` describes the
language `{4, 2}`, which contains two strings. The regular expression `(ab)*` 
describes the infinitely large set of strings `{ε, ab, abab, …}`. 

Given a regular expression and a candidate string, there are many ways to
determine whether the string **matches** the expression, i.e., whether the
string is in the set described by the expression. In this assignment, you don't
have to worry about implementing a matching algorithm—it's been provided for
you. Your job is to implement the _syntax_ of regular expressions: an easy way
for users to describe them.

## Implementing a DSL for regular expressions

**Note:** Be sure to read the entire assignment before you start implementing!

This repository contains some starter code. The most important pieces are:

**`RegularExpression.scala`** This file defines data structures that correspond
to the different kinds of regular languages described above. You'll modify this
file to write your DSL.

**`Program.scala`** A program that uses the data structures in
`RegularExpresion.scala` to build descriptions of regular expressions, then
match strings against those expressions. This program compiles and runs
correctly as-is, but it's clunky: it uses the data structures from the
regular expression library but it's not very DSL-y. Your job is to modify this
file to use your DSL instead.  The final version should look like 
[this](https://github.com/hmc-cs111-fall2016/practice-scala/wiki/Final-program).

There are a couple of other pieces of code provided:

**`RegexMatcher.scala`** This file defines an algorithm for matching a string
against a regular expression. You won't need to modify this file.

**`src/test/scala/dsls/regex`** Some test files for the matching algorithm. You
won't need to modify these files.

### The syntax for your DSL

The user of your DSL eventually should be able to write the following pattern:

```
"42" || ( ('a' <*>) ~ ('b' <+>) ~ ('c'{3}))
```

which matches either:
   + the literal string `"42"`   _or_
   + any string that has zero or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's,
   followed by exactly three 'c's

To do so, you'll need to:
   + implement literal extension, so that Scala strings can be treated as
   regular expressions
   + implement literal extension, so that Scala characters can be treated as
   regular expressions
   + implement the binary operator `||`, which corresponds to the union operation
   + implement the binary operator `~`, which corresponds to the concatenation
   operation
   + implement the postfix operator `<*>`, which corresponds to the Kleene star operation
   + implement the postfix operator `<+>`, which means "one or more repetitions of the
   preceding pattern"
   + implement the repetition operator `{n}` which means "`n` repetitions of the
   preceding pattern"

Use the materials from class, plus your own trial-and-error process to implement
all the features of our DSL. To implement literal extension, you'll need to 
use Scala's implicit conversion feature. Here is some information to help
you learn about this feature:
   + This [article](https://dzone.com/articles/implicit-conversions-scala) has
   a nice walkthrough of implicit conversion, with examples.
   + The [code from Tuesday's class](https://github.com/hmc-cs111-fall2016/complex/blob/master/src/main/scala/dsls/complex/Complex.scala)
   uses implicit conversions to help implement complex numbers.
   + The [slides from Tuesday's class](https://hmc-cs111-fall2016.github.io/slides/DSLs_Internal_Data_Structures.pdf)
   give a summary of the rules that govern
   implicit conversion (i.e., when does the Scala compiler employ implicit 
   conversions?)
   + _Scala for the Impatient, 2nd edition_, Chapter 21.4 describes implicit conversion
   in more detail.

## Reflecting on design / implementation

In the file `reflection.md`, you'll write about:
   + Your process of implementing the DSL
   + Your thoughts about the design of this DSL

I highly recommend that you **work on this part as you go.** In other words,
treat it as a running diary. Take a moment now to look at the questions in that
file, then update the file as you work on the assignment. Although you might
treat the file as a running diary, the version you submit should _not_ be a
stream of consciousness. Make your final submission clear and concise.

## Grading
Good responses (i.e., responses that receive a 3) will:

   + modify `RegularExpression.scala` to implement the internal DSL
   + transform `Program.scala` to work with the DSL
   + respond to the questions in `reflection.md`

Great responses (i.e., responses that receive a 4) will additionally:

   + provide very well-documented code in `RegularExpression.scala`.
   + deeply engage in the reflection process, e.g., by discussing the benefits
   and drawbacks of every operation in the language, from both the implementer's
   and user's perspective

# Critiques

After the submission deadline, read over and comment on your 
[critique partners'][Teams] work. Be sure to comment on their code _and_ on
their reflection.

Here are some suggestions for critiques:

   + What do you like about their implementation?
   + Is there anything that could be done to improve their implementation?
   + Did they implement things in the same or in different ways as you?
   + With which aspects of their reflection do you agree? With which aspects do
   you disagree?
